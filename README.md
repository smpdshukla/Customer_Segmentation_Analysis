# ðŸ“Š Customer_Segmentation_Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecom dataset using Python. It involves data understanding, cleaning, exploratory analysis, segmentation, and advanced analytics to derive insights that can help reduce customer churn.
# ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation and advanced analytics using telecom customer data.
It walks through the complete data science pipeline â€” from data understanding, cleaning, and EDA to visualization and advanced segmentation â€” to identify key behavioral patterns and churn risks.The insights can help telecom companies understand their customers, target marketing strategies, and reduce churn.
# ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
Task 1: Dataset Understanding
- Loaded the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- Checked data types, missing values, and data distribution.
- Summarized key features and target variable (Churn).
Task 2: Dataset Cleaning
-Handled missing and inconsistent values.
-Encoded categorical variables.
-Converted numerical columns to proper data types.
Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Visualized churn distribution and customer demographics.
-Analyzed relationships between churn and service-related variables.
-Derived insights using correlation and feature importance.
Task 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization
-Performed clustering and dimensionality reduction.
-Visualized customer groups to identify churn-prone segments.
Task 5: Advanced Analysis
-Applied advanced analytical techniques for deeper insights.
-Tested predictive patterns related to churn behavior.
